You should deliver a project with the following functionality (more details in session 1)

Requirements:


1- Login / Register
2- DB or Files
3- Request Rides
4- Payments
5- Many Ride Types Normal,  Premium, Bus, Motorbike
6- Support Tickets (customer care)
7- Many Routing algorithms (can be trivial like : price = distance*2)


Evaluation critiria:


1 - Applying SOLID principles

2- Using Suitable design patterns for each use case

3- No unnecessary usage of design patterns (KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid)

4- No unnecessary / unused code (YAGNI)

5- Sticking to languages' Coding conventions

6- Overall clean and readable code

7- GUI is a plus

8- Any Extra functionality / Ideas is a plus

9- The whole team should be aware of the architecture and ready to be asked about any part
